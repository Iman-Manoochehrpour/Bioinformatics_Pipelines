# üß¨ Bioinformatics_Pipelines

**Reproducible R pipelines for RNA-seq and miRNA differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and edgeR**

---

### üìò Overview  
This repository contains example R scripts demonstrating common bioinformatics workflows for RNA-seq and miRNA expression data analysis.  
All data used here are **simulated or public demo datasets** for educational and reproducibility purposes.  

The pipelines are based on analytical approaches developed in my master‚Äôs thesis:  
> *‚ÄúBioinformatics-based identification of candidate microRNAs and validation via qRT-PCR in bladder cancer patients for early detection.‚Äù*

### üß™ Example Workflows  

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 1. Differential Expression with DESeq2
```R
library(DESeq2)

# Load simulated data
counts <- read.csv("SampleData/simulated_counts.csv", row.names = 1)
meta <- read.csv("SampleData/sample_metadata.csv")

# Create DESeq2 dataset
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = meta,
                              design = ~ Condition)

# Run differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)

# Save results
write.csv(as.data.frame(res), "DESeq2_demo/DESeq2_results.csv")

# Basic MA plot
plotMA(res, ylim = c(-4, 4))
