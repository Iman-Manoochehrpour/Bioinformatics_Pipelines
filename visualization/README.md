# 📊 Visualization Outputs

This folder contains all **graphical and tabular outputs** generated by the analysis pipelines developed in the project  
**“Identification of candidate microRNAs for early detection of bladder cancer using bioinformatics and qRT-PCR validation.”**

All visualizations here are produced from **synthetic example data** using R scripts.

## 🧩 Files Overview

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `example_volcano_plot.png` | Demonstrates a volcano plot generated by `DESeq2_workflow.R`. Shows significant vs. non-significant genes based on adjusted p-value and fold change. |
| `example_wgcna_heatmap.png` | Example heatmap of module–trait correlations from `WGCNA_pipeline.R`. Colors represent correlation strength (red = positive, blue = negative). |

## 🧪 How These Were Created

The example visualizations were generated using the script  
[`generate_visualization_examples.R`](../generate_visualization_examples.R)

To reproduce them:

```R
source("generate_visualization_examples.R")
```

This script uses the synthetic data in example_data/ and exports the plots into this folder.

🧠 Notes

These visualizations are for demonstration purposes only.

The data used are entirely randomized and synthetic, ensuring no overlap with unpublished or confidential results.

You can replace the example plots with real outputs from your analysis pipelines.
